# My resume webpage using HTML and CSS

This web page contains a single web page that has some sections.
This resume has basic commands of HTML and CSS. I also used Notepad++ editor to edit the HTML and CSS files 

## Installation

used the Notepad++ Editor./
use this link https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.1.9.2/ to install for 64-bit.



## Usage of Notepad++ editor to edit and run files
-create a folder on your desktop.
-Open or edit the files in Notepad++ and save them as a .html extension and a CSS file as a .css extension in the folder you created.
-all the required images must be in the same folder as well.
-to run it, just open your .html file with any browser, or else it will not run.
